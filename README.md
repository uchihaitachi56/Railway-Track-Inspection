Firstly, prepare you dataset in yolo format and train the model from "Custom Training" file.
Download your best weights (which will be in the .pt format)
Go to the "yolo_training_example" file and use this trained file to complete your video which can be used on video inference.

NOTE: It is not subjected to only Railway Crack Detection. It is basically Object Detection, you can train any object you want to detect on custom training, you just need to modify the dataset. Now, use the best weights from this file for video inference.
